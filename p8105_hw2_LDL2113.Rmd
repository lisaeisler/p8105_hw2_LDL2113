## Homework 2, Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in read_excel
use reasonable variable names
omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

```{r}
healthy_harbor = 
  readxl::read_excel("./healthy_harbor.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N338") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) %>%
  drop_na()
```
